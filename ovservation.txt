In the Unit converter Module while scrolling category sections up then search and category should be sticky to top,
Time converter Under Unit converter has multiple tabs but favourite and recent history does not work based on those tab specific

We can make favorites and history tab-specific for all Time Tools tabs. Let me update the plan to support this.

also some result card like Age calculator Result card, and other tabs card should be more modern, aligned, iconified, polished.


--------------------
I think not all these are meaningfull to all users, thats why i think we should give almost all those a guide/help info,
There are several conversion we have implemented, can we group these as similar group wise?

Photo Studio:
toolbar should be positioned top of the screen so that it will not move under any other element.
Still cannot edit text, tapping to edit does not work.
Copy icon in the toolbar cannot see, if required you can increase the height of the toolbar. 
Different font can be selected for text.
==========================================
Presets act as shortcuts for your favorite conversion settings! ⚡

Instead of manually selecting "JPEG", typing in "1080px width", and setting a "500 KB limit" every single time, you can save that exact combination as a Preset.

It saves:

Format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, PDF)
Dimensions (Width & Height)
Target File Size
Quality Level
Example: You could make two presets:

"Website": WebP format, 800px width, 100 KB limit.
"Print": JPEG format, Original size, Max quality.
Then you just tap the chip (e.g., "Website"), and all those settings render instantly! 🚀

=====================
Yes we will focus on fixing and redesigning the Photo Studio module for the standard and modern UI designing, not too much space, no large or fatty icon and overall minimizing the redundant click of the user also performace too
